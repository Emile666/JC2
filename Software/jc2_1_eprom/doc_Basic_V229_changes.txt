Basic V2.29 is part of BIOS Eprom V1.2.4 and contains the following updates:

RETIRQ, RETNMI, IRQ and NMI are removed.

PORTIO <dev, iomask> call has remained the same, but now new IO-chips on the V4.1 main-board
                     and the IO2 board are supported.
<dev> is now a number between 0 and 9:
      0: PORTA of VIA U5 on IO-board (and IO2-board)
      1: PORTB of VIA U5 on IO-board (and IO2-board)
      2: PORTA of VIA U15 on JC2 V4.1 main-board
      3: PORTB of VIA U15 on JC2 V4.1 main-board
      4: GPIOA of MCP23017 with I2C-address $40 on IO2-board
      5: GPIOB of MCP23017 with I2C-address $40 on IO2-board
      6: GPIOA of MCP23017 with I2C-address $42 on IO2-board
      7: GPIOB of MCP23017 with I2C-address $42 on IO2-board
      8: GPIOA of MCP23017 with I2C-address $44 on IO2-board
      9: GPIOB of MCP23017 with I2C-address $44 on IO2-board
      10 and higher: error-message. No support for I2C devices anymore, use the PORT commands for this.

<iomask> is unchanged: a 1 defines a port-pin as output, a 0 as input.
      This is default behaviour for a VIA. For a MCP23017 this is exactly opposite, but this is taken care
      of by the software. So a 1 = output, 0 = input is valid for all IO!
Example: PORTIO 4,255 sets all bits of GPIOA of MCP23017 $40 as output.
         PORTIO 3,15  sets bits 7-4 as input and bits 3-0 as output of VIA U15 on the main-board.

PORT <dev, data>
      Has remained the same, but <dev> is now a number between 0 and 9, which is identical to the PORTIO command.
      This command sends databyte <data> to the IO-port. The port has to be set as output first with the PORTIO command.
Example: PORT 3, 192 sets bits 7 and 6 of VIA U15 to 1 and the other bits to 0.

PORT(dev)
      Has remained the same, but <dev> is now a number between 0 and 9, which is identical to the PORTIO command.
      This command reads databyte <data> from the IO-port.
Example: test = PORT(8) reads a byte from MCP23017 $44 GPIOA port.

SOUND ch, freq, att
      ch  : channel number: a number between 0 to 3, channel 3 is a noise channel.
      freq: divider for frequency generator, the frequency itself = 125000 / freq.
            freq is a 10-bits number between 0 and 1023.
            Example: a value of 125 results in a frequency of 1 kHz.
	    If ch = 3, then freq has another meaning:
            freq = 0..3: Periodic Noise
               0: Shift Rate is N/512 for noise generator frequency control
               1: Shift Rate is N/1024
               2: Shift Rate is N/2048
               3: Tone-generator 2 output is used for feedback control
	    freq = 4..7: White Noise
               4: Shift Rate is N/512 for noise generator frequency control
               5: Shift Rate is N/1024
               6: Shift Rate is N/2048
               7: Tone-generator 2 output is used for feedback control
      attn: attenuation for frequency generator, attenuation step-size is 2 dB:
            0: 0 dB attenuation (highest volume)
	    1: 2 dB attenuation
            2: 4 dB attenuation
            4: 8 dB attenuation
            8: 16 dB attenuation
           14: 28 dB attenuation
           15: OFF 
Example: sound 2, 284, 1 creates a 440 Hz signal with 2 dB attenuation at channel 2.
         sound 3, 5, 3   creates white noise with a shift-rate of N/1024 and attenuation of 6 dB
